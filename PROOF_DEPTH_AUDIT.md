## 2.5.5 Proof Gaps (Self-Reported)

### Areas where claims are made without proof:
1. **Generic ROI claims in Hero section:** "$200K+ ROI" and "500+ Hours Saved" (`components/Hero.tsx` line 76-78) - These aggregate numbers are not directly traceable to specific case studies or verifiable calculations
2. **Testimonial permissions:** No explicit permission statements for any testimonials (all implied)
3. **Testimonial images:** All testimonial photos are generic placeholders from picsum.photos, not real photos
4. **Case study constraints:** No constraints (time, budget, team size, tools limitations) are mentioned in any case study, which could raise questions about scalability/replicability
5. **Quantified metrics without methodology:** Metrics are presented as facts but no methodology for measurement is provided (e.g., how was "128 hours/week" calculated? Was it measured? Estimated? Tracked?)

### Areas where proof exists but is shallow:
1. **Testimonial depth:** Only 3 testimonials in main array, 2 are partially anonymized (John S., Fatima A.) with generic company descriptions
2. **Case study narrative depth:** While some case studies have rich "theMoment/whatWasAtRisk/whatChanged" narratives, others (OTP Dashboard, Logistics Automation Pipeline, Financial Data Integration, Team Performance Dashboard) lack this executive story format
3. **Client verification:** No LinkedIn links, company website references, or third-party verification anchors for testimonials
4. **Work experience details:** While outcomes are quantified, specific project timelines, budgets, and team sizes are not mentioned

### Areas where proof exists but is hidden behind interaction:
1. **Case study details:** Full case study narratives (including executive story format sections) are only visible on ProjectDetailPage, not on the case study listing
2. **Experience project links:** Projects linked from experience entries require clicking through to see full case studies
3. **Testimonial case study links:** Some testimonials link to case studies (clickable) but this requires interaction to discover
4. **Detailed metrics:** The full before/after metrics with charts are only visible in ProjectDetailPage, not in summary views
