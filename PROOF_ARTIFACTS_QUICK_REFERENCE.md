# PROOF ARTIFACTS QUICK REFERENCE

## The 3-Artifact Formula for Each Project Type

### **BI Dashboards** (Projects 2, 3, 6: QC, OTP, Team Performance)
```
Artifact 1: Before/After Dashboard Screenshot
Artifact 2: Trend Graph (Week-by-week improvement)
Artifact 3: Drill-Down Capability Demo (showing discovery)
```
**Skeptic Counter:** "I can see the tool, the trend, and how you found the problem"

---

### **Automations** (Projects 1, 4, 5, 7, 8: Deals, Logistics, Dispatch, Finance, Intake)
```
Artifact 1: Execution Log (timestamp, record count, milliseconds)
Artifact 2: Sample Input/Output Files (messy → clean)
Artifact 3: Process Flow Diagram (before/after stages)
```
**Skeptic Counter:** "I can verify speed, reproducibility, and transformation quality"

## PROJECT PRIORITY FOR ARTIFACT COLLECTION

### **HIGH IMPACT** (Start here)
1. **Dispatch Automation (Expack)** - Founder-built; 75% error reduction + 20% OTP gain = strongest credibility multiplier
2. **Deals Reporting** - Highest time-to-value (128h → 1min); most quantifiable
3. **QC Dashboard** - 41% defect reduction; hardest metric to fake (physical products)

### **MEDIUM IMPACT**
4. **OTP Dashboard** - Contract-breach scenario; high stakes make it credible
5. **Logistics Automation** - 48h → 1sec is dramatic; needs verification
6. **Financial Pipeline** - Low error rate claims need before/after evidence

### **LOWER PRIORITY** (Supporting evidence)
7. **Team Performance Dashboard** - Aggregate metrics; harder to make individual-level claims
8. **Client Intake Automation** - Less quantifiable impact; supports founder narrative

## WHAT NOT TO SHARE

| Artifact Type | Why It Hurts Credibility |
|---|---|
| Live system links | Exposes client systems; violates security |
| Full source code | Invites nitpicking; shows complexity, not results |
| Employee data | Privacy violation; undermines trust |
| Client names | Confidentiality breach; kills referral relationships |
| Internal complaints | Makes before-state look exaggerated |
| Unverified testimonials | Just adds more claims to verify |

---

## CREDIBILITY SCORING

Each artifact should be able to answer:
- ✅ **Objective?** (Numbers, not opinions)
- ✅ **Verifiable?** (Stakeholder could confirm it)
- ✅ **Specific?** (Not vague or ambiguous)
- ✅ **Confidential-Safe?** (No PII, no secrets)
- ✅ **Proportionate?** (Doesn't require deep dive to understand)

**Your portfolio currently has:** Excellent narrative + case study structure  
**Missing:** Tangible, third-party-verifiable proof artifacts

**This audit fills that gap.**

## NEXT ACTIONS

### Phase 1: Collect (Weeks 1-2)
- [ ] Screenshot QC dashboard (before/after months)
- [ ] Export 6-month error trend data for Finance project
- [ ] Get Dispatch error rate weekly logs (12 weeks)
- [ ] Capture Logistics execution times (10 sample runs)
- [ ] Screenshot Deals system output format
- [ ] Collect OTP trend data (week by week)

### Phase 2: Anonymize (Week 3)
- [ ] Redact all client/employee names
- [ ] Replace facility names with A, B, C, D
- [ ] Remove timestamps that reveal patterns
- [ ] Obscure financial amounts (use percentages)

### Phase 3: Integrate (Week 4)
- [ ] Add "Proof Artifacts" section to each project detail page
- [ ] Include 2-3 labeled screenshots per project
- [ ] Add caption explaining what each artifact proves
- [ ] Link artifacts to claims in the narrative

### Phase 4: Verify (Week 5)
- [ ] Client review and permission sign-off
- [ ] Final audit for any remaining PII
- [ ] Deploy to live portfolio

## THE WINNING FORMULA

**Narrative + Metrics + Artifacts = Unassailable Credibility**

Your portfolio now has 8/8 for narrative ✅  
Your portfolio now has 8/8 for metrics ✅  
**Next:** Add 8/8 for artifacts

This transforms your portfolio from "wow, impressive claims" → "wow, here's proof"
