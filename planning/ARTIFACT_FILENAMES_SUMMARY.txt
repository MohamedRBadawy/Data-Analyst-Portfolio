# Summary: Evidence & Artifacts Pre-Wiring

**Status:** ✅ Complete | **Build:** ✅ Successful | **Date:** Dec 30, 2025

All 8 projects now have Evidence & Artifacts sections pre-wired in `ProjectDetailPage.tsx`. Each project is configured to display 3 artifacts (PNG diagram, PDF report, CSV data) with relative links to `/artifacts/<project-id>/`. Code is production-safe and builds successfully. Artifact files are not required for code to function; links will gracefully handle missing files until they are added.

**Artifact filenames expected:**
1. **Deals Reporting:** execution-log.pdf, process-flow.png, output-sample.csv ✅
2. **Manufacturing QC:** dashboard-before-after.png, root-cause-analysis-sample.pdf, facility-defect-data-sample.csv
3. **Global OTP:** global-otp-dashboard.png, facility-otp-analysis-sample.pdf, weekly-otp-tracking.csv
4. **Logistics Automation:** scheduling-process-flow.png, automation-execution-log.pdf, scheduling-output-sample.csv
5. **Dispatch Automation:** dispatch-workflow-before-after.png, awb-generation-sample-batch.pdf, dispatch-performance-metrics.csv
6. **Team Performance:** team-performance-dashboard.png, performance-coaching-example.pdf, team-performance-weekly.csv
